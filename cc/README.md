1. my teaching style
	* I'm here for you
	* teach you how to use Go
		* I'm assuming you're here to learn Go
		* I don't want to just show you a solution, I want teach you how to create a solution
		* teach through example
		* code review, not coding
			* allows for effective learning
				* pause video, try to understand code, then continue video
				* keeps your brain engaged and active, not just passively watching
		* give you too much, as opposed to not enough
		* point out useful resources
		* give you an awesome code base
			* examples that show you different patterns in Go
	* If I talk too fast for you:
		* slow me down - not everyone knows they can slow a video down
		* rewatch the video
	* David Gassner's "Up And Running With Go"
	* most consumable solution
		* I'm aiming for 
			* the most consumable solution
			* solutions that teach you important concepts about the language
			* not always going to achieve this, but that's what I'm aiming for
	* important: my focus isn't on the solution, my focus is on helping you learn Go
	* Go idioms
		* idioms defined
			* idioms - patterns of speech
				* cultures / sub-cultures have their own patterns of speech
			* language to describe the language
		* "idiomatic Go"
	* Go vs Golang
		* golang.org
			* official website
			* resources for learning
				* https://golang.org/doc/
